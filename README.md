# emotion-ui

> Web interface for Emotion Detection models on Large Scale Datasets

The EmotionUI connects to the interface provided by the `serve.py` [module](https://github.com/nur-ag/emotion-classification/blob/master/src/serve.py) in the companion repository for "[Uncovering the Limits of Text-based Emotion Detection](https://github.com/nur-ag/emotion-classification/)". We provide Docker images for the best performing models in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nursystems/emotion-models).
